//1. What is the Big O for this?
//  1. O(1) - Constant
//  2. O(n) - Linear

//2. Even or Odd
//Logarithmic time O(log(n)) - becauseut cuts the problem in half

//3. Are you here?
//Polynomial O(n^k) - nested loop

//4. Doubler
//Linear O(n) - because you do one operation for each value in the array

//5. Naive search
//Linear O(n) - goes through each value of the array
// best case scenario - O(1) - Constant where the 1st value is the item.

//6. Creating pairs
//Polynimial O(n^k) - nested loop

//7. Compute the sequence
//Fibonnici sequence - Linear O(n)
